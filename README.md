- In this study, the spoiler_weight, vehicle_angle, and AWD all contributed to non-random variances. In terms of random variance, two variables are most significant: ground_clearance and vehicle_length.

- By looking at the p-value, which is less than 0.05, we can tell that our slope is not zero.

- A R-squared value of 71% means that our model will accurately predict mpg values in approximately 71% of the instances. The MechaCar prototypes' MPG vary for various reasons that are not accounted for in the dataset.

- MechaCar's suspension coils are designed to have a variance of no more than 100 pounds per square inch.The design specs are respected across all manufacturing lots with a global variance of 62.3 psi.Lot 1 and Lot 2 are in specs with respectively a variance of 0.98 and 7.5 psi. With a variance of 170.3 psi, Lot 3 is out of specs.
